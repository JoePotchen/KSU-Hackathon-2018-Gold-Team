# Anthem Hackathon 2018




## Questions
* Are we limited as to what APIs and libraries we can use?
* On that note, can we use something like a Google account to do secure log in?
* Should we build the entire app or just the data pages?
* Will we be given sample data? How will we access it?
* Is there a specific platform we should be targeting?

## Notes from presentation

* Steve Durbis is the Anthem Innovation Studio
* Mike, Jerome are on the team

### Incovation Studios
* All the materials will be on a google drive space
* Centered around data
* Ability to orchestrate analyze and visualize data sets
* We are given data
* Orchestration, analysis and visualization
* Hundreds of thousands and millions of claims that come in constantly.
* Taking a lot of datasets, how we can take that data and orchestrate it and come up with insights on it.
* Different insurance plan rates.
* Census data base on income
* Can we make correlations between the 2 data sets
* Can we use other data to come up with correlations? Geographic, etc
* Come up with insights as to why some data point is the way that it is.
* This is more of a datascience thing
* This is less of an app and more of just dealing with data.
* Machine learning model
* We are evaluated on how well we can use the data. They are not looking for anything specific.
* The output is how well we can visualize the data we glean from this.

### Voice enabled AI
*  Appointments, reminders "You haven't done this in a while, do you want to do this?"
* Your child's heart rate has increased by X%
* The idea is to lessen the amount of time that a parent has to spend worrying about a disabled child's disabilities.


### Research Notes
* Find more data sets
* Find libraries to visualize datasets
* Technologies for big data
* What should we program in?
